    <p> I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the National University Of Singapore, hosted by Diptarka Chakraborty and Kuldeep S. Meel. I obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Tata Institute Of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. Before that, I completed my B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Guwahati.

   <p>My research interest is broadly in algorithms and complexity with a focus on sublinear algorithms. Recently, my research has been centered on statistical estimation problems in small-sample regimes. Here is my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LdsmqoDwVncAUA-PBkEizlKPsZ46fSzd/view?usp=sharing">resume</a>.  </p>


Together with  a few colleagues, I helped to organize 
the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comp.nus.edu.sg%2F~tvanbr%2Falgotheory22-23.html&sa=D">AlgoTheory seminar</a>  at NUS.
